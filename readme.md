# The Wall Coding Dojo

In this exercise I create a template that you register and access a webpage when you would post messages, comments, and delete messages when it is your messages.

This is humbke version of facebook, when you only could post text (not images, video or reshare).

I use structures to log in, register (when you haven't signed up before), use of database in Django, and use od Jquery, Bootstrap, css and HTML.

This is my first humble application, I spent a really good time
